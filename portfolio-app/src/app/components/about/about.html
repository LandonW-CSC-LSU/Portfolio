            I'm an undergraduate Software Engineer student at Louisiana State University,
            with a passion for building software that makes a difference. I have experience in
            full-stack web development, software engineering principles like Agile, and several leadership roles. I'm a creative 
            and detail-oriented problem solver who enjoys working in a team to produce high-quality software.
