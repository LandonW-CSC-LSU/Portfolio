        <p>
            I'm an undergraduate Software Engineer student at Louisiana State University,
            with a passion for building software that makes a difference. I have experience in
            full-stack web development, and I love working with technologies like 
            Angular, React, Node.js, and more to create creative and intuitive web applications.

            I'm always eager to learn new skills and technologies to become a better developer.
